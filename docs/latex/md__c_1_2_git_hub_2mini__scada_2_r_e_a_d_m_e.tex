 The goal of the project is to implement a client-\/server connection. The program allow data to be sent from the server and received by the client. The client is then to be able to edit the way this data is displayed, i.\+e. a different type of graph, a different color and line thickness, etc. The program will be implemented using C++ language taking into account object-\/oriented programming paradigms. The logic of the program will be based on the Qt library, including structures such as QTcp\+Server, QTcp\+Socket, QByte\+Array, etc. Basic program elements\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item GUI interface to start the server, generate data and create new clients,
\item An interface unique to each client, through which they will be able to connect to the server, display and save data,
\item Communication between the client and the server,
\item Classes that allow data storage and transfer,
\item The ability for the client to save data, both on disk and on the system clipboard,
\item Ability for the client to edit the way the data is displayed, including changing the chart type, changing the line thickness, changing the names of the data series, etc.
\item Signaling of server status and client connections.
